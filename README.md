# Genty

Genty is a general-purpose Discord bot with a wide variety of functionality.

## Token
For Genty's safety, the token is stored in a file ".env" which is accessed at runtime.

## Prefixes

Genty stores individual prefixes for each guild in a json file. Upon joining a guild, Genty sets the default prefix as '%'. This can be changed later and will be updated in the bots memory. When Genty is removed from a guild, it will wipe its memory of a guild's prefix.
